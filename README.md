# Diabetes Prediction using Machine Learning 🏥📊

This project aims to predict diabetes using machine learning techniques, particularly the **Random Forest** classifier with **hyperparameter tuning**. It includes **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to gain insights from the dataset and feature engineering to improve model performance.

## 🚀 Features
- Data Preprocessing and Cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations 📈
- Feature Engineering for better predictions
- Random Forest Classifier with Hyperparameter Tuning 🌲⚙️
- Model Evaluation and Performance Metrics

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle:  
🔗 [Diabetes Prediction Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iammustafatz/diabetes-prediction-dataset/data)  

It contains medical diagnostic measurements used to determine diabetes likelihood. The features include **glucose levels, insulin, BMI, age, blood pressure, etc.**  

## 🛠️ Installation & Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Diabetes-Prediction-ML.git
   ```

## 📊 Model Performance
